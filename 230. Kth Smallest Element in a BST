What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently?
How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

Initialize a max-heap while searching the kthSmallest.
If the max-heap's size is less than k, insert the tree node's value.
If the tree node's value is smaller than the max value of the max-heap, replace them.

Every time an insertion occurs, check whether the tree node's value is smaller than the max value of the max-heap.
If yes, replace them.

Evert time a deletion happens, check whether the tree node's value is smaller than the max value of the max-heap.
If yes, reinitialize the max-heap.

The time complexity of initializing the max-heap is O(k). 
The time complexity of the insertion is O(lgk).
The time complexity of deletion is O(k).
The time complexity of looking up the kthSmallest is O(1).

The space complexity is O(k).
