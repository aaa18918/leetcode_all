In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)

Return the number of regions.

 

Example 1:

Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "
]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input:
[
  "\\/",
  "/\\"
]
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input:
[
  "/\\",
  "\\/"
]
Output: 5
Example 5:

Input:
[
  "//",
  "/ "
]
Output: 3

Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
