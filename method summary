1.Read and understand the question carefully!(Under what conditions)
2.Always consider the corner cases, especially the "", None cases.
3.If something has different length, plus them together can get same length.
4.str([1]) = "[1]".
5.a = [1, 2, 3], str(a) = '[1, 2, 3]'.
6.Notice whether it is find the Kth largest number or the Kth smallest number.
7.Check whether a string only contains lower case letters.
8. " ".split("  "): ['', '', ''].
9. " ".join([]): "".
10. List is unhashable in set.
11. Binary Search or any formula similar to the left < right format,
    take care of the increaing the left pointer and the decreasing of the right pointer.

Linked Lists:
- Two points
- Dummy head
- Reverse Linked List needs to set the head.next equals to None

List or String:
- Divide and Conquer

List[List] or List:
- Search from end to start

backtracking:
- Remove record(visited) when False or True, so that only one visited matrix required.

Comparation:
- Less than, Greater than. (Not Equal)

Maybe right:
- Write all the branches first, clear and concise. Then clearify the code.

Sort Algorithms:
- Quick Sort: nlogn
- Merge Sort: nlogn
