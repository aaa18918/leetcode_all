Given a string representing arbitrarily nested ternary expressions, calculate the result of the expression. You can always assume that the given expression is valid and only consists of digits 0-9, ?, :, T and F (T and F represent True and False respectively).

Note:

The length of the given string is ≤ 10000.
Each number will contain only one digit.
The conditional expressions group right-to-left (as usual in most languages).
The condition will always be either T or F. That is, the condition will never be a digit.
The result of the expression will always evaluate to either a digit 0-9, T or F.
Example 1:

Input: "T?2:3"

Output: "2"

Explanation: If true, then result is 2; otherwise result is 3.
Example 2:

Input: "F?1:T?4:5"

Output: "4"

Explanation: The conditional expressions group right-to-left. Using parenthesis, it is read/evaluated as:

             "(F ? 1 : (T ? 4 : 5))"                   "(F ? 1 : (T ? 4 : 5))"
          -> "(F ? 1 : 4)"                 or       -> "(T ? 4 : 5)"
          -> "4"                                    -> "4"
Example 3:

Input: "T?T?F:5:3"

Output: "F"

Explanation: The conditional expressions group right-to-left. Using parenthesis, it is read/evaluated as:

             "(T ? (T ? F : 5) : 3)"                   "(T ? (T ? F : 5) : 3)"
          -> "(T ? F : 3)"                 or       -> "(T ? F : 5)"
          -> "F"                                    -> "F"


class Solution(object):
    def parseTernary(self, expression):
        """
        :type expression: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        
        my_stack, expression = [], list(expression)
        
        while len(my_stack) > 1 or expression:
            last_five = my_stack[-5:]
            if len(last_five) == 5 and last_five[3] == '?' and last_five[1] == ':':
                if last_five[4] == 'T':
                    my_stack[-5:] = [last_five[2]]
                else:
                    my_stack[-5:] = [last_five[0]]
            if expression: my_stack.append(expression.pop())
        
        return my_stack[0]

discuss里别的解法再看一下啦啦啦😝。
