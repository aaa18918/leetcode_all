Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.


class Codec:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.encodeTable = {}
        self.decodeTable = {}
        self.letters = string.ascii_letters+"0123456789"

    def encode(self, longUrl):
        """Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        
        :type longUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        
        if longUrl in self.encodeTable:
            return self.encodeTable[longUrl]
        else:
            tinyUrl = ''.join([random.choice(self.letters) for _ in range(6)])
            self.encodeTable[longUrl] = tinyUrl
            self.decodeTable[tinyUrl] = longUrl
            return ''.join(longUrl.split('/')[:-1])+tinyUrl

    def decode(self, shortUrl):
        """Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        
        :type shortUrl: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        
        return self.decodeTable[shortUrl[-6:]]

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))


随便写写的，有许多地方值得琢磨。
